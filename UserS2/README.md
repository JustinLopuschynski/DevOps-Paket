# User-Story 2

As an Admin, I want to connect devices to the application. The Devices are sending MQTT Messages, which are needed in the Application. 
We need an Endpoint in Azure, which receives all the IoT messages. 
- Task 1: Find a Resource to receive IoT messages
- Task 2: Create a Resource Template for it
- Task 3: Create Parameter Files for dev, test and prod resources
- Task 4: Extend the Deployment Script for this resource
