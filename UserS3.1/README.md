# Code Explanation 

### This script is written in a domain-specific language (DSL) for deploying resources in Azure. It defines the configuration for creating an IoT Hub and a Storage Account in Azure, along with associated settings.

## Parameter Definitions
The script starts with defining parameters that will be used throughout the deployment process. These parameters are set in dev-,prod- and test_parameters.yaml. You have to change these parameters with your data:

- demoName: A string parameter used as a prefix for naming resources.
- location: A string parameter representing the datacenter location for deployment. It defaults to the location of the resource group.
- skuName: A string parameter representing the SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) to use for the IoT Hub.
- skuUnits: An integer parameter representing the number of IoT Hub units.
- d2cPartitions: An integer parameter representing the number of partitions used for the event stream.

## Variables 
The script defines variables that will be used to generate unique names for the IoT Hub and Storage Account, as well as specifying the storage container name and endpoint.

## Resource Definitions 

- Storage Account Creation: The script creates a Storage Account resource with the specified name, location, SKU, and properties. It enables public access to blobs and shared key access.
- Container Creation: It creates a container within the Storage Account with the specified name and sets the public access level to "Container". This container will be used for storing 
results.
- IoT Hub Creation: The script creates an IoT Hub resource with the specified name, location, SKU, and properties. It configures event hub endpoints for events with retention time and 
partition count. It also defines routing endpoints to the storage container created earlier, along with messaging endpoints for file notifications and cloud-to-device messaging.


## Explanation

- The script sets up an IoT Hub and a Storage Account in Azure for handling IoT device messages.
- It ensures that messages from IoT devices are routed to the specified storage container for storage and further processing.
- The Storage Account is configured to have a container for storing results, with public access enabled.
- Various properties such as retention time, partition count, and messaging endpoints are configured for efficient handling of IoT data.
- The script utilizes parameters and variables to ensure flexibility and uniqueness in resource naming and configuration.

Overall, this script automates the deployment of necessary Azure resources for handling IoT data streams effectively.
